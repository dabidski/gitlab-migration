* Extend CodingFields so that we can attach them to rooms (ie. add Room to the options for :item_type)
* Further extend CodingFields to have a ""cascade"" field, only for item_type==:Room, defaulting to false, description ""Cascade this field to documents and folders in the Safelink API"".
* Extend the field editor UI accordingly
* Add an ""Extended Properties"" section to the Manage Room (rooms#edit) form if any coding fields are defined for the room, allowing room managers to see and update these values.
* Add a :handler to hooks.rb called :init, with description ""Initialise your app when it is installed or upgraded"".  This would be the first handler; handlers should be able to accept arguments but return nothing.
* Don't implement :init properly yet, I'm not sure how we'll detect upgrades, but do add a ""Re-initialise"" link next to the edit link in the app listing on manage room pages.  This will be kinda temporary, and only available to people with call_any_function rights.  Calling this will trigger the relevant :init handler, if the app is actually enabled.  Later, we'll actually detect app installations and upgrades and have it trigger automatically.
* Extend the metadata API (it'll end up being in HybridMetadata) to automatically include fields cascaded from the room into Documents and DocumentFolders, if any are defined and have cascade == true.   This would affect list_fields and metadata_values_for, at least, and maybe other places.
* Add an MC function called create_or_update_metadata_field that can be called like this:create_or_update_metadata_field(item_type: ""Room"", name: ""partner_name"", value_type: ""text"", cascade: true), with cascade defaulting to false.  This function should create or update based on the key of [current_room, name, item_type].

Then, create an MC app (in the MC UI) called Ocorian SeeUnity Integration, and give it an init hook that creates the room metadata fields if they don't exist.

Perhaps we have another pair of methods on AsyncSendWithKey, ie another send and another receive method, that allows a UserSecrets object to be sent instead, ie. an intermediate key and a user id.

I think there's a few small changes we should make. 

Please would you change ""reference"" to ""number"" and this will mean we should change the ""change reference when renumbering""

We should have the same terminology and functionality as the document properties page so that it's easier for the user to understand.

So let's have ""this number is provisional"" on both for now.

And please would you also change the ordering drop down to the same order options as we have for the sort on the main page for the same reason.

I’m wondering if we should have just two options;
1. At the bottom
 The client can do a sort and re number if they want them elsewhere in the list or manually rearrange them before numbering
This would for work for both alphabetical and arrangement numbering and we are not messing around with the folder then docs numbering etc too  

2. Infill. This could be for both systems too (I think!) if the user makes the two extreme folders non provisional numbered then they would be added in alphabetical order or upload order

There is some confusion about what ""sort by date"" actually means, I think, which is causing some difficulty in coming up with a fix.

After the current batch of numbering changes is released, let's create two ""sort by date"" options: ""Record Date"" and ""Added Date"".

""Record Date"" means the date that an email was sent, or the date that a Word doc was last saved, or the date that a photo was taken (for JPEGs).  Sometimes this will be undefined/nil, in which case the document goes to the bottom of the list (as if it has a date far in the future).  Or even better, this can be defined using a compound key, so we sort by [saved/sent/taken date, then doc-uploaded-date], that way the sort order will be unique and consistent.

""Added Date"" means the created_at field in the Documents table.

The inconsistency seen by Amy may be because of the expectation that ""date"" refers to the added date, but in fact it referred to the saved/sent/taken date, which was undefined/inconsistent for many documents (and always will be).

The intermediate can be found here: https://search.thawte.com/support/ssl-digital-certificates/index?page=content&id=INFO4671

We've spotted two issues with the certificate setup for portal.ocorian.com<http://portal.ocorian.com>, one of which I can resolve, and the other of which will need attention before September.

The first is that we will need to obtain and install an intermediate certificate that completes the chain between the portal.ocorian.com<http://portal.ocorian.com> certificate and the Thawte primary root CA certificate; I believe our various browsers are filling this gap by downloading the intermediate certificate. If you happen to have a copy of the intermediate certificate handy, it would be great, otherwise I will find it, it's publically available.

The second is that Chrome and Firefox will stop accepting the *.ocorian.com<http://ocorian.com> certificate in September 2018, citing security problems at Symantec, who own Thawte.  Info on that is here: https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2017/09/26/google-and-mozilla-deprecating-existing-symantec-certificates<https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2017/09/26/google-and-mozilla-deprecating-existing-symantec-certificates>

Just trying to get this connector working today following some metadata exposure by Safelink and sadly still can't get anything to talk as SeeUnity won't talk to Safelink, instead giving the following log entry:

I've checked the account that SeeUnity uses to access Safelink ('Ocorian') and that is working just fine so it doesn't seem to be a permissions or server access issue at the Safelink end and sadly the message above doesn't give me much to go on.

The screenshot below shows the full story:

Description - We want to prevent anyone other than an Ocorian employee becoming a Room Admin (e.g. no Gmail, Hotmail or external email address - anything not @ocorian.com): how might this be best implemented?",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/160018265,Donn Jerico Belmonte,," @karlanderson1 May I know please know where could this be implemented? (Vincent Paolo - Jul 24, 2019)","Let's add this as a Hook in a custom app - see the Hooks module for info.  I'm adding a new ""validator"" kind of hook now that will work well for this. (Karl Anderson - Jul 24, 2019)","I've pushed some WIP code here @pao https://github.com/khanderson/safelink/tree/160018265-only-allow-ocorian-users-to-be-room-managers that introduces a new ""custom validator"" concept and a ""room_user_validator"" validator hook.

Rough design:
* Add a Rails validation to the RoomUser model that calls Hooks.evaluate_validator(:room_user_validator, ...).  That method should return any 'problems' as strings, so if it returns any entries in its array, they should get pushed up to become regular Rails-style validation errors.  We'll need good tests for this please.
* Implement a sample Monkeychain app that has a hook that will return [""Only Ocorian users may be Room Managers""] if the room user is a room manager but is not at @ocorian.com, and return [] otherwise.
* Add a ""cannot_disable"" field to room_type_features, with a corresponding checkbox in the room type edit form.  If that ""cannot_disable"" field is set, prevent the app from being disabled on the manage room screen, and show it as greyed out.

Upon release, we'll have to paste the Hook code into one of Ocorian's apps, and set the ""cannot_disable"" flag for it.

Requester: jonathan.lee@ocorian.com, 
Description: 

Jonathan Lee would like the ability to see if emails sent from the Safelink system were delivered to the client. 

Proposal from KA:

That we offer a global ""Sent Mail"" option under ""Manage"", that lists all mail sent to users under a licence.  Ideally it would use the Omnibrowser for this (using a collection with id ""SML"", building on the current type of ""SM"").

It only be available to Licence Managers and would show all emails from the outbound_emails table whose:
* room_id refers to a room from the user's current licence; or whose
* site_configuration_id corresponds to the user's licence's site_configuration.

Note that OutboundEmail does not have a site_configuration_id column.  This will need to be added, included in an index, and populated for new emails that are sent.  We won't be able to populate them retroactively.

Finally, when displaying emails of type activation_code or invited_to_room_notification, please blank out any strings that contain activation codes (format is HHHH-HHHH-HHH-HHHH, where H can be any letter or number), with ""XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"".

Ocorian will need to amend their T&C for each room soon. Currently, this can only be done by manually opening each room and applying the new terms and conditions. 

They have amassed 71 rooms under their licence and going into each room individually to apply new T&C's would be tedious.

We call the latter ""Site Terms"", which need to be accepted after login or activation, with the limitation that the user is required to accept the site terms only once (is that okay for them?).  Additional terms could still be required at the room level if needed (by enabling both).  If that suggestion doesn't work, let me know we'll look at other alternatives.

Hi Jam, 
The sort by upload date is working
The Sort by record date doesn't appear to be functioning correctly. So far I've added two documents, one was created in 2016, the other one this week. When I sort by record date the 2016 doc (labeled A) is next to a doc from this week (B) and within two docs that were created at exactly the same time (as they are  a copy of each other (labelled C & D). Maybe my understanding of record date is incorrect, and I don't know a way to check on the date the doc was created on our system, is there a way to see that info? But it doesn't look to me like it's sorting correctly. (Amy Bath - May 15, 2019)","hi @amybath, to know more about record date. 
https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/165299806/comments/201659700

""Record Date"" means the date that an email was sent, or the date that a Word doc was last saved, or the date that a photo was taken (for JPEGs). Sometimes this will be undefined/nil, in which case the document goes to the bottom of the list (as if it has a date far in the future). Or even better, this can be defined using a compound key, so we sort by [saved/sent/taken date, then doc-uploaded-date], that way the sort order will be unique and consistent.

The record dates of the files you uploaded are probably null, because those files are note coming from email or a word doc last saved. (Jammaica Ignacio - May 15, 2019)"," @jamignacio I though PDF's also had  a creation date, is that not the case?
As we have two stories covering this , do you want to close one? (Amy Bath - May 15, 2019)","I would much prefer to have a numbering project and then all the stories are together but as we are hopefully almost at an end of these, it's probably not worth it

The story is not related to this story because the additional 2 sort options are already added and the numbering works on those 2 sort options.

The issue happens when folders and documents have been manually arranged (it doesn't seem to happen with the folders/docs are arranged by sort and save)
This is the process i did,
With ""no numbering"" applied in the room and no confirmed numbers. I used the ""arrange documents"" from the left hand actions menu to set up my docs  (in this case folders at the top and then docs) and clicked finish arrangement. (each doc move gave  a ""saved"" message). 
Then I clicked on numbering at the top of the folder tree. 
I applied numbering with ""keep the same arrangement"" but it didn't! It appears to be alphabetical

Upon further investigation I've found this bug is much bigger and  I think it is a fundamental error with the application of numbering. Everything is still being numbered alphabetically regardless of the document order/sort order. So when I save the sort order and apply numbering the documents are numbered alphabetically (but without changing the position in the list) . They are not numbered according to the sort order .

1. A simple way of doing it would be to associate a time period with the group definition.
“Grant group privileges to members:”
Permanently
Only during <time period name 1>
Only during ...
So you’d have to create a time period first, then associate it with the group (in Room Settings). Users in that group would still be able to log in and access the room, but they would just have access to whatever an ungrouped user does outside of the time period.

2. Or maybe that’s too complicated and doesn’t solve the problem
Maybe an “Allow Workspace Access” option on the group screen, with those same options?
Not affecting permissions, just doesn’t let the user in at all. (Nanneke Shilliday - Nov 8, 2019)","  @rodnerraymundo will this be one that you have time to work on?

Let's have an endpoint /collections/<collection_published_id>/metadata that returns something like:

```javascript
{
  entry_types: [
    {
      type: 'EntryType',
      entry_type: 'CustomRecord',
      entry_subtype: 'Claim',
      collection: <collection_published_id>,

        { field: 'page_count', position: 'bottomleft' },
        { field: 'creator', position: 'bottomleft' }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The ""position"" information should be used to determine  where each field goes in the rendered output.  The positioning should basically match the way documents are rendered, see screenshot, where:

* ""Acccount Activation.html"" is in the top-left position, and becomes a link
* ""1 page"", ""version 3"" are both in the bottom left position; if there's more than one of these, comma-separate them.
* ""1.41 KB"" is in the bottom right position.
* There is nothing showing in the top-right position, in the screenshot, at least.

For now, for custom records, just specify it so that ""name"" goes in the top left, and that's it.  In a later story, we will tie this in to the table_spec concept, so that MC developers can control what we show for each custom record.

I want to move toward having a consistent endpoint for fetching entries from collections, so that we can use our Mk2 browser for more stuff.  This new endpoint should be JSON-only.

Move some controller actions to CollectionController:
1. Move CustomTablesController#search to be CollectionsController#search, which can be accessed as /collections/<container_published_id>/search
2. Change the autosearch component to use this new interface (it uses search_room_table_url(current_room, table) atm, see _record_autosearch.html.erb).
3. Info for individual items should come from /collections/<container_published_id>/entries?ids=pubid1,pubid2,pubid3
4. Items endpoint should return extended information about the requested items, like [{ id: published_id, type: 'Document', subtype: null, model_attrs: { name: 'DocName', reference: ""1"" }, pres_attrs: { tag_ids: [""ST1234"", ""ST1235""], desc_texts: [], action_tokens: [] } }, { ... }]

I can't think of a circumstance where you wouldn't want to replace existing numbers because any numbering that the user wants to keep would be marked as ""non provisional"" (now called confirmed) on the the folder or document properties tab

I think on the format options we should describe both alphabetical options ie the first option should say ""Folders and documents in order"" or something similar

Under Rules, maybe it should make it clearer that the fill is with new uploads, something like ""New uploads to fill gaps in existing numbering"" Do we need to add a note somewhere that the default is after the last folder or document no.?



 (Amy Bath - Feb 27, 2019)"," @amybath 
1. hmm, I didn't put it there because it will order all the files anyway regardless of folders or documents (compare to the 2nd option where there's a distinction) but I could add that easily if it makes it more clear.

3. Sorry I got confused! , New uploads by default are added to the system in alphabetically order (hopefully according to the system chosen above ie alphabetically folders then doc OR all alphabetically- we might need to check that) or if the box about infill is ticked..then it will be where there are file numberspaces (this is because ocorian always have no 1 and no 99 and want the new uploads to be within those folder numbers not start at 100)
So I was thinking maybe we want to explain that the default is that files will add alphabetically...but maybe that's not necessary

Karl raised a concern about what happens if they are just numbering 1 folder....and I'm just working through this as much for my understanding of the  process as yours
.... so say I number all my folders with hierarchical numbering and then I want to change where new docs are uploaded to the ""infill"" option. I click on numbering and i get the page and i can click the button. That's good for changing all the folders.
But what if I have already set up 1 folder to be no numbers...That would be ok I think because any docs that are infilled or need renumbering on moving will just be un-numbered in that folder....do you agree?
But what if I have no numbering applied and then I add numbering to 1 folder...when I then go into the numbering screen again from the top of the document tree would I see the full numbering page and would I know that it was just one folder that this applied to?  And what if I had numbered 3 folders out of 50 folders and chosen different rules for each one?

* The precomputed ordering is being recalculated when FolderContentsCollection#entries is called; that's okay I think
* How does this relate to numbering?  After numbering is done, does the next call to FolderContentsCollection#entries see the ordering as stale and re-calculate the pre-computed ordering?  Is that what's happening here?

I'm interested to know the above, but regardless of that, I think the problem will be this.  The docs you've shown in your screenshots mostly won't have record dates.  That means that the key given to 'sort by' generated at line 82 of with_precomputed_sort_order.rb will be

```[1, timestamps_by_document_id.fetch(entry.id, default_timestamp), entry]```

which for undated docs will eval to

```[1, default_timestamp, entry]```

And when when comparing two arrays like that with <=> the comparison will come down to doc1 <=> doc2.

<=> is defined for docs in SortableFolderEntryMixin, and  is kind of magical, it sorts by reference/number if there is one, or sorts by other things (name, upload date, id) otherwise. 

Before the  numbering, reference/number was not defined, so the sort-by-date for undated docs ended up being sort-by-name, and after the numbering, the sort-by-date for undated docs ended up being  sort-by-reference/number.

When I change the number of a folder using the right click ""Folder Properties"" command the numbering of the folder contents does not change. When I upload to that folder the new numbering is applied to the new addition.


Currently the sort position changes when changes are made from the folder properties page but the numbering doesn't...the folder needs to have ""no numbering"" and then numbering reapplied.

So we have two different change protocols.

It may be unwise to allow users to change the internal folder numbering from this page. All other numbering changes require a two step, no numbering/renumbering process

Hi Jam,
It's still not adding numbering to the subfolders when there is no numbering in the room.
Step 1. no numbering is applied to the room
step 2. In folder properties a number is added to the folder (in this case 59)
Step 3. number folder contents is ticked

This should mean that all the subfolders and documents are numbered (hierarchically) within that parent folder because the box was ticked to number the folder contents and that hasn't happened. (Amy Bath - Jul 23, 2019)"," (Amy Bath - Jul 23, 2019)","Note for me

We will introduce the concept of upfront vs on-demand authentication mode which will be choosable for a given site.  In a situation where a user had access to a room ""Alpha"" that had a username+password security policy and a room ""Beta"" requiring 2FA, the user would need to complete 2FA (via an allowed mechanism) on login if the upfront mode were chosen, or only when accessing ""Beta"" in the on-demand mode.  The current implementation of security policies uses on-demand mode by default.  Prior to this concept being introduced, we'll hard-wire the system to use the upfront approach and confirm when this is done.

Let's temporarily hard-wire ""upfront"" mode to be on, so that after login, we determine ALL of the upgrades that might be required and do them upfront.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168558686,Donn Jerico Belmonte,,"Commit by Donn Jerico Belmonte

2. Same as 1, but with authentication mode ""upfront"", we should get the same result.
3. With authentication mode ""on demand"", a user that has access to one workspace that requires 2FA, and other workspaces that do not require 2FA is not prompted for 2FA when logging in, but is prompted for 2FA when accessing the workspace that requires 2FA.
4. Same as 3, but with authentication mode ""upfront"".  This time, the user _should_ be prompted for 2FA on login, because they have access to at least one site that requires 2FA.

174487436,Implement authorisation rule for PostVestingInstruction,security,123,"Mar 1, 2021","Mar 7, 2021",feature,1,unstarted,"Aug 25, 2020",,,Karl Anderson,"**Concern about the security model underpinning the Post Vesting Instruction mechanism**

The problem is rooted in the requirements, which allow any vestee that has access to the portal to see a ""post vesting instruction"" record and its associated document, if they can provide a correct combination of EIN, Surname and Vesting Date combination.

The assumption is that EIN is secret information known only to the employees.

The first problem is that if this assumption does not hold and someone does know the EIN of another employee, they would likely also know the employee's surname and possible the vesting date, and would be able to search for and find the post vesting instruction record.  My understanding is that this concern has been considered by yourselves and the client, and that the risk was determined to be acceptable.

The second problem is that, due to this requirement, it is not possible to define a rule within the platform that can determine whether a given user should be able to see a given post vesting instruction record and its associated document.  Normally we would have a function of the form ""f(user, record)"" that looks at the user information and the record information that returns true or false, depending on whether the record should be visible.  But since the user records do not include the EIN, and the post vesting instruction records do not include a user ID or email address, there is nothing for that function to match on.  The impact of this is that, if a user knows what records to look for (by ID, or by EIN/Surname/VestingDate combination), they could see those records as there is no rule to stop them.

**Design**

Access to the record is granted by virtue of a search.

New custom table: PostVestingInstructionAccessGrants, with two fields: user, and post_vesting_instruction.  A new record gets created on each successful search.  Permissions required for PostVestingInstruction records to be [own_record_id].  Permissions granted to user to be the array of post_vesting_instruction id entries for that user from the PostVestingInstructionAccessGrants table.

It's the screen with the tiles that show view/download/etc permissions.
But if there are too many documents, there is too much data to load, and the screen loads and runs very slowly.  So I added a limit that says that if there are more than 500 docs (in total, in all of the folders you're looking at), we don't show docs at all in that display, so you can only see and change permissions for the folders themselves.
It seems that Jonathan is hitting that limit.

There's a workaround, in that, if you click ""edit permissions"" on one of the subfolders, such that the subfolder (and its subfolders) contain fewer than 500 docs, then it should be able to show all of them.
But that's a terrible workaround.  It needs the magic of someone like JM or Rodner to make the system load the documents on-demand, so that it can handle folders (and document counts) of larger sizes.

 (Nanneke Shilliday - Dec 5, 2019)","I'm not sure yet how to implement this in a better way.
Maybe if we enable live redaction in a room, room managers can create redaction markers and then click on a ""Apply Redactions"" button.

Editing redactions and then clicking apply redactions will update the document again.

I think this needs Karl's input.  (David Sumulong - Jun 23, 2020)","  There are two ways to go with this:

**Dynamic**
Redacting user makes redaction, and can continue to see through it, move it or remove it at any time, along with any other users who are authorised to do so.  But, when a regular user views or downloads the doc, the redactions are indelibly applied: they would see a rasterised (image) version of any page that had redactions on it, and the redacted content would be fully covered (as it is when you apply redactions currently).  Redactions would also be optionally applied on export, as it is currently.

**Static**
Redacting user makes redaction.  At some point, redacting user chooses to ""apply redactions"" or ""replace with redacted"".  The original document is replaced with a redacted version for all users, once again with the redactions applied indelibly.  It would no longer be possible for the redacting user (or other authorised users) to see through those redactions or remove them (except by reverting the document to a previous version).

The static option would be safer, in that it's less prone to accidents, like someone getting the permissions wrong.  But the dynamic version would be more flexible; you can amend your redactions over time and always see what was under them.

@nannekeshilliday @davidsumulong I think we need to decide what we want, maybe with input from the customer(s).  I'd prefer the dynamic sort of redactions, just because it'd be more awesome, but I'm not the target audience.  We could have both.

 (Nanneke Shilliday - Jul 3, 2020)","Okay so we're going for static redaction first.  The the process would be:

* User creates redactions in the normal way on one or more documents (no change).
* Assuming use of omnibrowser: user selects one or more documents (that have redactions) and chooses ""Apply Redactions""
* Prior to the use of the omnibrowser (initial release): user right-clicks on document and chooses ""Apply Redactions""
* A form pops up and asks what should happen to the redacted documents:
 * Should they replace the original document, and if so, should the original be kept as a previous version, or discarded completely? [This will be the only option that's within scope, initially]
 * Or, should they be saved in the same folder with a ""Redacted"" suffix on their name? [Out of scope]
 * Or, should they be saved to another folder, and if so, which folder? [Out of scope]
 * Or, should the user get a copy of them as a zip file. [Out of scope]
* User makes selection and confirms.
* System asynchronously redacts each document, showing an ""Applying Redactions"" label against each document until the redaction process is complete.

Story:
* Room Manager right-clicks on the folder to be duplicated.  System shows a duplicate sub-menu, with two options: ""Structure Only"", and ""Structure with Documents""
* User chooses ""Structure Only""
* System says ""Duplicating, please refresh shortly to see the new folder.""
* System creates a copy of the folder structure, asynchronously, with the name ""#{original name} Copy"", or if that name is already taken, ""#{original name} Copy 1"", or if that it taken, ""#{original name} Copy 2"", etc.
* User refreshes after a while and sees the new folder.

**Implementation**
Here is an example of using copy_to:
```ruby
f1.copy_to(f1.parent_document_folder, copy_permissions: true, as_user: user, new_name: name)
```

copy_to does not have an option to not copy documents: it will need one.  Default behaviour should be to copy the documents.

There may be a need to trigger re-numbering, if numbering is enabled.

Client Description -

Following discussions at senior levels within Ocorian, we would like the capability to track and block excessively large downloads from data rooms as a form of simple data loss prevention (DLP).

Background and Objective
The issue being addressed is that for many clients their portal will contain not only GDPR-relevant data but, for some, also the data 'crown jewels' of the entities and structures that they administer and, whilst we are implementing internal DLP precautions on the Ocorian network, these do not protect content in SafeLink and so would not help in the scenario of a user (client or Ocorian, disgruntled or otherwise) viewing or downloading the entire contents (that they can access) of a room or rooms for potentially unauthorised purposes.

Potential solution
The kind of enhancements that we had in mind were to

1.       Set default time and size thresholds limits for document views and downloads on a per room basis (e.g. max 25% of content in any 24 hours); these defaults to be managed centrally for the Ocorian licence via the management portal but amendable on a per room basis by Room Admins with all changes logged to the room audit trail

2.       An admin portal report to be created that lists the settings for all Ocorian rooms so that we can monitor compliance

3.       If view limits are exceeded by any user, generate immediate high-priority alerts by email and SMS message to all Room admins of the affected room  (we would need to capture mobile phone numbers for Ocorian room admins)

4.       If any user exceeds the download thresholds, message the room admins as above and block that user from downloading any content until authorised by a room admin (which would effectively reset that user's 'allowance')

We recognise that there is a significant risk of false positives here and so would welcome a discussion on how best to meet the objective outlined above as there may be better solutions already in place within the platform.

Furthermore, an early solution would be appreciated.",https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168725241,David Sumulong,,"FOR REFERENCE: Moved here and cloned from story #156794126 in Design project so that DS has access.

its doable but in a bit hacky. The way I think we can implement this is to implement a lockable feature (same way as devise uses lockable) but just have a generated random key that we can send to the users.

scenario: User has enabled a 2 way authentication
ea. If the user logged in they will be locked (but still logged in) it will trigger a lock flag wherein can be unlocked by the code we send to their mobile phones. 

I think I can explain a much better implementation thru call.

Let's first extend Cloner so that it has an async_clone method that creates a Computation record and schedules the work, returning the computation.

The async handler method for this will need to use computation#recording_execution and #record_outcome (see processable line 114 for example).  If possible, supply some tracking info to the tracker provided by #recording_execution so that we can update the client.

#record_outcome takes a hash; we can pass { :result_id => new_room_id} to it.

Then we can add an API method like POST /rooms/:id/clone, which will start the clone and return an object that just contains a computation_id (which will need to be a published id).

Then we'll need another API method, perhaps GET /computations/:computation_id, which can return an object like { complete: false, progress: 0.7, succeeded: nil, result_id: string, running: true, message: """" }.  The user should be able to access computations created by them.

The result_id would be a room ID, which the caller could fetch if they want.  We'll need a GET /rooms/:id for this.

That the phone number data that appears in the restored phone number fields is correct as per previous data (e.g. the formatting on some looks a little odd in terms of spaces etc that we would normally never enter)

""Hi RJ,
 
As discussed, the logic I'm using in terms of user triage is that the one's to verify first are
 
1.       Does primary email address end @ocorian.com  - if Yes then ignore

2.       Does user's only room access = Project Laurel  (https://portal.ocorian.com/rooms/39402) - if Yes then ignore

3.       All remaining users should have both a mobile phone number AND ""Require SMS Authentication"" = TICKED
 
 
So far, the first 9 users I've looked at in level 3 have all been FAILS; i.e. they have a mobile phone number but ""Require SMS Authentication"" is UNTICKED.  I've been ticking this as I go along but my concern #1 right now is that they have been logging in without SMS codes for the last 3 weeks or so and now will suddenly start getting SMS codes again which is going to raise questions big-time!
 
My concern #2 is that Karl told me when we first set up 2FA that the best way to disable a user's access to Safelink was to tick the ""Require SMS Authentication"" box but not put in a mobile phone number. Does this mean that all those in that category are currently denied access or is 2FA somehow not being enforced?

• Where a user's account pre-dates the setup of SSO, it would start out as being a non-SSO account.  It can stay that way indefinitely (possibly a problem).  When they next log in, they are given the option to convert their account to SSO.  But it's only an option (also potentially a problem).

Please explain that there may be more to it than this, I'd like to look at the examples he's given and produce a comprehensive answer that covers all the questions. (Karl Anderson - Mar 15, 2019)","As discussed, the logic I'm using in terms of user triage is that the one's to verify first are

1.       Does primary email address end @ocorian.com  - if Yes then ignore
2.       Does user's only room access = Project Laurel  (https://portal.ocorian.com/rooms/39402) - if Yes then ignore
3.       All remaining users should have both a mobile phone number AND ""Require SMS Authentication"" = TICKED

So far, the first 9 users I've looked at in level 3 have all been FAILS; i.e. they have a mobile phone number but ""Require SMS Authentication"" is UNTICKED.  I've been ticking this as I go along but my concern #1 right now is that they have been logging in without SMS codes for the last 3 weeks or so and now will suddenly start getting SMS codes again which is going to raise questions.

My concern #2 is that Karl told me when we first set up 2FA that the best way to disable a user's access to Safelink was to tick the ""Require SMS Authentication"" box but not put in a mobile phone number. Does this mean that all those in that category are currently denied access or is 2FA somehow not being enforced?  (Either answer is potentially bad…)

2 more things:

a)      Going through some of these names has indicated that I need another list showing
1.       the ""Require SMS Authentication"" flag field status
2.       the mobile phone number
3.       for all users whose email address is NOT @ocorian.com

If it's possible to filter out those whose only room access is to Project Laurel then that would be fab but don't worry if that's hard, I can filter those manually if necessary. In case it helps, the company name field for all Project Laurel users should say ""Project Laurel"".

b)      All the accounts in the second table (shown below) can be deleted *(RJ has removed the accounts)*
a.       Interestingly I thought the two abaxservices.com accounts had already been deleted but never mind…

Lastly...

The following users are all internal Ocorian users but, with the exception of Linesh Mungur, show as non-SSO users when they are all SSO users, or should be:
